# ME597-AITS-Demo-Codes

This is a repository for the demo codes and assignments developed by me as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course ME597- Artificial Intelligence in Thermal Systems taught by Dr. Veeraraghava Raju Hasti for Fall 2020. 

The course covered topics on Machine Learning and Deep Learning with demo examples shown in the lecture to give a practical experience to the students. 

Topics:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine
3. Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbours
4. PCA and LDA
5. K Means Clustering 
6. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
7. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
8. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
